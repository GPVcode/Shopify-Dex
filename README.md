# Frontend (React)

## UI Framework
For a modern and sleek design that is mobile-responsive, we can utilize Material-UI or Tailwind CSS. Both are highly customizable and offer a range of components.

## State Management
Given the complexity of the app, Redux or Context API for global state management would be suitable. For local state, React hooks can be utilized.

## Data Fetching
Axios or Fetch API for handling API requests. Consider using React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.

## Responsive Design
Use responsive design principles with CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure mobile responsiveness.

# Backend (Node.js)

## API Integration
Implement RESTful API endpoints to interact with the Shopify API.

## Authentication
Implement Shopify OAuth for secure authentication.

## Database
If needed, consider using MongoDB for its flexibility and compatibility with Node.js.

# Testing

## Frontend
Jest alongside React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.

## Backend
Mocha and Chai for Node.js API testing.

# Deployment

## CI/CD Pipeline
Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using GitHub Actions.

## Hosting
Consider using services like Heroku or AWS for hosting both frontend and backend.
